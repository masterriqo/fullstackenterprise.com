    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY &amp; INTAKE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)</h2>

    <p>
      To engage in <strong>commercial services</strong>, Clients must meet all
      applicable conditions outlined below.
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Required Documentation (Services Engagements)</h3>

    <p>
      For executional or implementation-oriented Services, Clients must provide,
      prior to engagement:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>documented business plan</strong>, and</li>
      <li>A <strong>documented marketing plan</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Verbal explanations, aspirational ideas, or informal notes do not qualify.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clients without these documents may be declined, paused, or routed to
      advisory-only engagement at Contractor’s discretion.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Agency &amp; Participation Requirement</h3>

    <p>Clients must:</p>

      <li>Engage with data, constraints, and tradeoffs</li>

    <p>Clients acknowledge that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Decisions are constrained by economics, time, skills, and market behavior</li>
      <li>Aspirational projections are not substitutes for validation</li>

    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>2A. CONSULTING &amp; ADVISORY ENGAGEMENTS</h2>

    <p>
      Consulting and advisory engagements are <strong>distinct from Services engagements</strong>
      and are advisory, diagnostic, or strategic in nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      These engagements do <strong>not</strong> involve direct execution, implementation,
      or operational ownership unless explicitly stated in writing.
    </p>

    <h3>2A.1 Documentation Requirements (Consulting &amp; Advisory)</h3>

    <p>
      For consulting or advisory engagements, Clients <strong>may be required</strong>,
      prior to or during the engagement, to provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A documented business plan, and/or</li>
      <li>A documented marketing plan</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In some cases, such documentation may be <strong>developed collaboratively</strong>
      as part of the consulting scope.
    </p>

    <p>
      Documentation requirements will be clarified prior to engagement and may
      differ from executional Services requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>2A.2 Scope &amp; Responsibility</h3>

    <p>In consulting and advisory engagements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Client retains <strong>full responsibility</strong> for execution and outcomes</li>
      <li>Guidance, analysis, and recommendations do <strong>not</strong> constitute guarantees of results</li>
      <li>Any implementation or execution support must be <strong>explicitly agreed upon in writing</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Absent such agreement, Contractor responsibility is limited strictly to advisory input.
    </p>

    <h3>2A.3 Visibility &amp; Representation (When Applicable)</h3>

    <p>
      Visibility, transparency, or access requirements apply <strong>only</strong> when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Visibility is a material constraint of the Client’s business model, or</li>
      <li>Such requirements are explicitly included in the agreed consulting scope</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Any such requirements will be communicated in advance and documented where applicable.
